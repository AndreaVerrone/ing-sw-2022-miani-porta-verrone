### Usage

In the `deliverables/jar` folder there are 3 `.jar` files: one for the server,
one for the CLI and one for the GUI. In order to run the jars, clone this repository or download the `.jar` files.

Then, from the command line of your operating system, place inside the folder in which the jars are located and run the following command:

    `java -jar <name-of-jar>.jar`

where `<name-of-jar>` is one of the following:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Name of jar</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Command</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PSP31-server</td>
<td>Starts the server</td>
<td>

```bash
java -jar PSP31-server.jar
```
</td> 
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PSP31-cli</td>
<td>Starts the CLI</td>
<td>

```bash
java -jar PSP31-cli.jar
```
</td> 
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PSP31-gui</td>
