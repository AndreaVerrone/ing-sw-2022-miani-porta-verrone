## Introduction
This is the final test of "**Software Engineering**" course of "**Computer Science Engineering**" held at Politecnico di Milano.

It is a Java versione of the board game "_Eriantys_" made by [Cranio Creations](https://www.craniocreations.it/).
You can find out more about the game [here](https://craniointernational.com/products/eriantys/) (italian version [here](https://www.craniocreations.it/prodotto/eriantys/)) or download the [english rules](https://craniointernational.com/2021/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Eriantys_rules_small.pdf) or [italian rules](https://www.craniocreations.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Eriantys_ITA_bassa.pdf).

### Usage

In the `deliverables/jar` folder there are 3 `.jar` files: one for the server,
one for the CLI and one for the GUI. In order to run the jars, clone this repository or download the `.jar` files.

Then, from the command line of your operating system, place inside the folder in which the jars are located and run the following command:

    `java -jar <name-of-jar>.jar`

where `<name-of-jar>` is one of the following:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Name of jar</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Command</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PSP31-server</td>
<td>Starts the server</td>
<td>

```bash
java -jar PSP31-server.jar
```
</td> 
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PSP31-cli</td>
<td>Starts the CLI</td>
<td>

```bash
java -jar PSP31-cli.jar
```
</td> 
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PSP31-gui</td>
<td>Starts the GUI</td>
<td>

```bash
java -jar PSP31-gui.jar
```
</td> 
</tr>
</table>

> If you run the CLI, we suggest you to set the background color as grey to not interfere with the other colors. Also, a command line that support Unicode and UTF-8 is recommended for a correct experience. If you use Windows and you don't have one, or you're not sure, we suggest to follow the instructions on this [link](https://akr.am/blog/posts/using-utf-8-in-the-windows-terminal) to get one.
